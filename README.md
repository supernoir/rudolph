### Rudolph checks if you're online or not, and if you are not, his nose will be bright red!
Rudolph is a small js app that you can include into your app or website to check if the user is connected to the internet. It uses an XHR request to figure out the current network status and reports back to the user through a small graphic of the famous reindeer along with an optional info that gives you a bit more detail on the status.
